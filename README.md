## Real-Time Notification System with RxJS, Node.js and TypeScript

**Motivation**

This project aims to build a real-time notification system using RxJs, Node.js and TypeScript. This system will provide users with the following functionalities:

- **User Subscriptions:** Users can subscribe to specific notification types, allowing customization based on their needs.
- **Real-Time Delivery:** Notifications are delivered instantly as they occur, ensuring timely updates.
- **Actionable Notifications:** Users can interact with notifications directly from the interface for seamless navigation.

**Implementation**

**Features Implemented**

- User subscription management
- Real-time notification delivery using Observables
- Ability to create different notification types (e.g., messages, mentions, alerts)
- Potential for handling basic actions within notifications (navigating to specific content)

**Additional Features (to be considered for future development)**

- User presence management for optimized delivery
- Advanced notification personalization options
- Integration with specific communication channels (e.g., email, mobile push notifications)
- Persisting notification history

**Steps of Execution**

1. **Project Setup:**

   - Initialize a Node.js project directory.
   - Install dependencies: `typescript` and `rxjs`.
   - Configure `tsconfig.json` for type checking and compilation.
   - Set up project directory structure (src/, node_modules/, etc.).

2. **Observables and Event Streams:**

   - Design observables to represent different notification event streams.
   - Utilize RxJS operators to filter, transform, and combine these streams.

3. **User Subscriptions:**

   - Implement logic for users to subscribe/unsubscribe from notification types.

4. **Real-Time Delivery:**
   - Use observables and subscriptions to deliver notifications in real-time.

**Note**

- This is a basic structure for the project. Specific implementation details will vary depending on your desired functionalities and chosen communication channels.
- Consider error handling, memory management, and testing practices when building reactive systems.

**Getting Started**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. (Optional) Compile TypeScript code: `npx tsc`
4. Refer to the `src` directory for the core implementation.

**Future Enhancements**

- Explore advanced features like presence management and notification persistence.
- Integrate with specific communication channels for broader notification delivery.
